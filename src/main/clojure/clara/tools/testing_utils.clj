(defmacro def-rules-test
  "This macro allows creation of rules, queries, and sessions from arbitrary combinations of rules
  and queries in a setup map without the necessity of creating a namespace or defining a session
  using defsession in both Clojure and ClojureScript.  The first argument is the name of the test, 
  and the second argument is a map with entries :rules, :queries, and :sessions.  For example usage see
  clara.test-testing-utils.  Note that sessions currently can only contain rules and queries defined
  in the setup map; supporting other rule sources such as namespaces and defrule/defquery may be possible
  in the future.

  Namespaces consuming this macro are expected to require clara.rules and either clojure.test or cljs.test.
  Unfortunately, at this time we can't add inline requires for these namespace with the macroexpanded code in
  ClojureScript; see https://anmonteiro.com/2016/10/clojurescript-require-outside-ns/ for some discussion on the 
  subject.  However, the test namespaces consuming this will in all likelihood have these dependencies anyway
  so this probably isn't a significant shortcoming of this macro."

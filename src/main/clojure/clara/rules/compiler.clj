  "The default max number of forms that will be evaluated together as a single batch.
   5000 is chosen here due to the way that clojure will evaluate the vector of forms extracted from the nodes.
   The limiting factor here is the max java method size (64KiB), clojure will compile each form in the vector down into
   its own class file and generate another class file that will reference each of the other functions and wrap them in
   a vector inside a static method. For example,

   (eval [(fn one [_] ...) (fn two [_] ...)])
   would generate 3 classes.

   some_namespace$eval1234
   some_namespace$eval1234$one_1234
   some_namespace$eval1234$two_1235

   some_namespace$eval1234$one_1234 and some_namespace$eval1234$two_1235 contian the implementation of the functions,
   where some_namespace$eval1234 will contain two methods, invoke and invokeStatic.
   The invokeStatic method breaks down into something similar to a single create array call followed by 2 array set calls
   with new invocations on the 2 classes the method then returns a new vector created from the array.

   5000 is lower than the absolute max to allow for modifications to how clojure compiles without needing to modify this.
   The current limit should be 5471, this is derived from the following opcode investigation:

   Array creation:                                                    5B
   Creating and populating the first 6 elements of the array:        60B
   Creating and populating the next 122 elements of the array:    1,342B
   Creating and populating the next 5343 elements of the array:  64,116B
   Creating the vector and the return statement:                      4B

   This sums to 65,527B just shy of the 65,536B method size limit."

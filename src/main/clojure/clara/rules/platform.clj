  "Groups the items of the given coll by f to each item.  Returns a seq of tuples of the form
  [f-val xs] where xs are items from the coll and f-val is the result of applying f to any of
  those xs.  Each x in xs has the same value (f x).  xs will be in the same order as they were
  found in coll.
  The behavior is similar to calling `(seq (group-by f coll))` However, the returned seq will
  always have consistent ordering from process to process.  The ordering is insertion order
  as new (f x) values are found traversing the given coll collection in its seq order.  The
  returned order is made consistent to ensure that relevant places within the rules engine that
  use this grouping logic have deterministic behavior across different processes."
